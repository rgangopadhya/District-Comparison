D3 Matrix scatterplot-linked to geography:
Uses a matrix scatterplot where points are geographic regions linked to a map to allow for easy selection.  Takes the ideas of http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063663 but (in this particular application) instead of looking at correlation between variables, this compares utilization volume/intensity for a given service by region.  

My goals are to clean up this code a bit, so that the matrix scatterplot is moreabstracted for future purposes.
